</p>   Tørdal Property   During 2011 we entered into option agreements with REE Mining AS of Norway, to obtain exploration   rights to several properties located in central and southern Norway. Based on exploration results and   holding costs, the Tørdal property holding was retained but all other Norway properties were subsequently   dropped. The Tørdal agreement was renegotiated to secure a 100% ownership position for SCY.   
</p>  
The 90 sq km Tørdal exploration property is prospective for a grouping of specialty metals, and rare earth   elements, including scandium, yttrium, tantalum, beryllium, niobium, zirconium, titanium, lithium, nickel   and tin. Certain of these metals are subject to Norwegian government controlled mineral rights and others   are subject to landowner mineral rights. The Company has decided the lack of clarity in mineral rights   control at Tørdal raises unacceptable risk to continuing forward with additional exploration at this time.   
</p> 
Accordingly, the Tordal property mineral exploration rights were not renewed in January 2017, and the   Company has no further plans for the property at this time.   </p>   Tørdal Property   During 2011 we entered into option agreements with REE Mining AS of Norway, to obtain exploration   rights to several properties located in central and southern Norway.

The location of the Tørdal property is provided in Figure 6 below.   Figure 6. Location of the Tørdal property   2012 Tørdal Field Exploration   On February 14, 2013 we announced promising results from field exploration work on the Tørdal   property during the summer and fall months of 2012, focussed on scandium-bearing pegmatites. The   2012 work included independent assay results of pegmatite rock samples taken from one specific property   area, and also includes an extensive pegmatite mapping program covering approximately 30 sq km. The   assay results indicated the presence of high levels of scandium and various rare earth elements (REE’s),   including heavy rare earth elements (HREE’s) in particular. Field XRF readings indicated elevated   scandium content in hundreds of large and small pegmatite bodies found and mapped in the   reconnaissance area.   Highlights of the results of the 2012 field exploration are as follows:
</p> 
Tørdal 2012 assays of pegmatite rocks show presence of both scandium and REE’s;   Best scandium assays exceed 1,600 ppm;   Promising HREE assay results from pegmatites with gadolinite mineralization;   Host rock mineralization points to higher grade scandium or HREE contents;   2012 summer exploration program mapped and sampled over 300 pegmatites;   A total of 1,940 Niton XRF scandium readings were taken on whole rock samples; and   Overall program results at Tørdal are very encouraging and warrant expanded exploration.   
</p> 
Assay Results of Grab Samples at Tørdal   The 2011 summer exploration program on the Tørdal property consisted of reconnaissance, surface soil   sampling, and limited pegmatite mapping work in a relatively small area north of the village of Kleppe, in   Southern Norway.   37As a follow-on from that 2011 program, the company then returned to the same area and conducted a   series of ‘blasts’, using small explosive charges to generate whole rock samples on select exposed   pegmatites, at the locations of the best soil sample results. The exploration team planned 9 blasts and   conducted 8, on 5 different pegmatite bodies, from which they assembled 23 grab samples for analysis   and assay by OMAC Laboratories in Ireland. Assay results on these samples were received in Q1 2012—   in time to help formulate the 2012 summer/autumn season pegmatite mapping program, conducted on a   much wider area.   Independent assay results on 20 of the 23 samples, covering all 5 targeted pegmatites, are shown below.

</p>   NOTE: All blast samples taken from Kleppe area (Area 1), total of 5 unique pegmatites   Sample   Type   Note: Assay results are as-reported elemental assay results from OMAC Laboratories, and are not converted to   oxide equivalent (REO & Sc 2 O 3 ). Heavy rare earth elements abbreviated “HREE”; and include Yttrium;Total rare   earth elements abbreviated “TREE”.   The numbered assay samples were formed either by random selection of fresh (un-weathered) whole rock   material broken loose from individual pegmatite bodies, or alternatively, based on selectively collecting   fresh rock material that was clearly (1) garnet-laden, (2) mica-laden, or showed clear visible (3) gadolinite   mineralization. Gadolinite is a beryllium and rare earth-bearing mineral with the chemical formula   [(Ce,La,Nd,Y) 2 FeBe 2 Si 2 O 10 ]. The intent was to determine from assay results if certain visible   mineralization correlated to the presence and concentrations of target elements; specifically scandium,   rare earth elements (REE’s), or other metals of interest and value.   
</p> 
The results in the assay table indicate that all of the selected pegmatites contain interesting levels of both   REE’s and scandium. In general, all of the pegmatites contained both target elements, while the mica   phase appears to hold the higher scandium concentrations with small REE additions, and the gadolinite   phase holds the highest REE concentrations and small scandium additions. The presence of garnet   38material in samples tended to generate interesting but moderate values for both REE’s and scandium.   Assay work was designed to identify 30 specific elements, including all 16 REE elements plus scandium,   and the relative concentration of heavy REE’s was of particular interest. The mica and garnet grab   sample materials had generally only trace levels of thorium and uranium (average  less than 15 ppm), while the   gadolinite grab sample materials had thorium levels between 2,500-5,000 ppm, and uranium levels   between 500-1,300 ppm.

A full table of OMAC assay results related to these 23 sample analyses is   available on the Company website at www.scandiummining.com.   Reconnaissance Results – Extended Pegmatite Mapping Program at Tørdal   Following on from the 2011 work and the 2012 assay results, we conducted an expanded 2012 summer   work reconnaissance program at both Tørdal and Evje-Iveland, from July through October. The goals of   the 2012 program were to develop detailed mapping of outcropping pegmatite fields over a much broader   area than the 2011 program, while also conducting field sampling of scandium mineralization on those   pegmatites using a hand-held Niton XRF Analyzer.   The 2012 program concentrated on five separate areas (approximately 30 sq km) as can be seen in the   map below:

Figure 7. Map of the Extended Pegmatite Mapping Program at Tørdal   A total of 1,940 Niton XRF readings were logged on whole rock and pegmatite mineral separates, logged   against individually mapped and numbered pegmatite bodies. The XRF readings ranged up to +6,000   ppm scandium (on a mineral separate), and averaged 661 ppm on 1,504 total logged readings above the   instrument’s 20 ppm detection limit. XRF readings focussed on scandium data collection only, although   the team diligently noted the visible presence of gadolinite and amazonite mineralization.   39The reader is cautioned that hand-held Niton XRF readings are not the same as laboratory assays, and are   not NI 43-101 compliant with regard to estimating resource grades. However, the Company is confident   that these data readings are highly useful in confirming and shaping the next stage of the exploration   program on this property.   A summary of results by area is as follows:
</p> 

</p>
<img src="scimc-map.png" alt="Area 1 (Kleppe); Mapped more than 50 pegmatite bodies" width="100%" height="100%">
</p>

  Area 1 (Kleppe); Mapped more than 50 pegmatite bodies. Best average XRF Sc readings from   1,000-1,500 ppm, some very large surface expressions. Gadolinite present.   Area 2 (Heftetjern); Partially mapped more than 40 pegmatite bodies, many large surface   expressions, green amazonite mineralization. Better XRF Sc readings from 500-1,500 ppm.   Area 3 (Solli); Mapped numerous large and small pegmatites. Generally lower XRF Sc readings,   ranging 300-700 ppm. Red feldspars, quartz and gadolinite mineralization present.   Area 4 (South Kleppsvatn); Partially mapped large area containing more than 80 pegmatites,   generally mica-based. Typical XRF Sc readings in the 300-900 ppm range, with some reaching   1,500 ppm Sc.   Area 5 (Buvatn); Partially mapped, numerous pegmatite bodies, some very large. Typical XRF Sc   readings in the 300-1,000 ppm range. Old feldspar quarries, amonizite mineralization present.

Next Steps in Norway Exploration Program   The Company mapping and sampling work has confirmed that much of the Tørdal property is heavily   populated with complex, near-surface pegmatite bodies. Based on hand-held XRF readings and   mineralogy, these pegmatites show excellent promise for significant scandium enrichment, particularly   within bodies containing micas, and for REE mineralization where the rare earth silicate gadolinite is   present. Based on the results of 2012 exploration work, planning for future exploration work is under   consideration, but is dependent on the Company’s ability to adequately fund further exploration work.   The priority project is the Nyngan Scandium Project, so funding for further exploration in Norway is   specifically subject to adequate prior funding of Nyngan.

Qualified Person and Quality Assurance/Quality Control   Sampling methods followed industry quality control standards. Mr. Kjell Nilsen, an independent   geologist consultant currently employed by SCY, conducted the reconnaissance and sampling on the   property. Individual whole rock grab samples were collected by hand shovel, from areas where blasted   material could be seen to have come from blast points on pegmatite bodies. The assayed samples were   individually bagged, sealed, logged on the grid map as to location, boxed in a container suitable for   mailing, and sent by express mail to OMAC Laboratories Limited in Galway, Ireland for testing. Assay   testing on the samples utilized an ICP-MS spectrometer (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass   Spectrometry) to test for numerous elements, specifically scandium. The numerous Niton XRF (X-ray   Fluorescence) readings were taken at field locations, logged and identified with individual numbered   pegmatites, located on grid maps, by the field geology team. Mr. Willem Duyvesteyn, Chief Technology   Officer of SCY, is the Qualified Person who is responsible for the design and conduct of the exploration   program, and reviewed the program results.
